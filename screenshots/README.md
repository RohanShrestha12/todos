Screenshots folder

Place the required screenshots here before submitting the task. Recommended filenames:

- `todos_index.png` — Todos index page
- `todos_create.png` — Create todo form (showing image upload)
- `todos_edit.png` — Edit todo form (showing existing image preview)

How to capture

1. Start the app: `php artisan serve`
2. Visit the routes and capture screenshots using your OS screenshot tool or browser devtools.
3. Save files to this folder and commit them.

Example commit commands:
```
git add screenshots/*
git commit -m "Add screenshots for submission"
git push origin main
```

If you want, I can add placeholder files (empty `.gitkeep`) so the folder exists in the repo.
